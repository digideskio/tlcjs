= Program Structure =

In this chapter, we will expand our command of the JavaScript language
beyond the nouns and sentence fragments we've seen so far, to the
point where we can express some meaningful prose.

== Expressions and statements ==

(((grammar)))(((syntax)))(((code,structure
of)))(((grammar)))(((JavaScript,syntax)))In
link:01_values.html#values[Chapter 1], we made some values and then
applied operators to them to get new values. Creating values like this
is an essential part of every JavaScript program, but it is only
a part.

(((literal expression)))A fragment of code that produces a value is
called an _((expression))_. Every value that is written literally
(such as `22` or `"socialism"`) is an expression. An expression
between ((parentheses)) is also an expression (like `(1 + 2)`), as is
a ((binary operator)) applied to two expressions (like `"hello " +
"there!"`) or a unary operator applied to one (like `!true`).

(((nesting,of expressions)))(((human language)))This shows part of the
beauty of a language-based interface. Expressions can nest in a way
very similar to the way subsentences in human languages are nested—a
subsentence can contain its own subsentences, and so on. This allows
us to combine expressions to express arbitrarily complex computations.

(((statement)))(((semicolon)))(((program)))If an expression
corresponds to a sentence fragment, a JavaScript _statement_
corresponds to a full sentence in a human language. A program is
simply a list of statements.

(((syntax)))The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a
semicolon after it. This is a program:

[source,javascript]
----
1;
!false;
----

It is a useless program, though. An ((expression)) can be content to
just produce a value, which can then be used by the enclosing
expression. A ((statement)) stands on its own and amounts to something
only if it affects the world. It could display something on the
screen—that counts as changing the world—or it could change the
internal state of the machine in a way that will affect the statements
that come after it. These changes are called _((side effect))s_ (we'll
see an example of a side effect in the next section!). The statements
in the previous example just produce the values `1` and `true` and
then immediately throw them away. This leaves no impression on the
world at all. When executing the program, nothing observable happens.

(((programming style)))(((automatic semicolon
insertion)))(((semicolon)))In some cases, JavaScript allows you to
omit the semicolon at the end of a statement. In other cases, it has
to be there, or the next ((line)) will be treated as part of the same
statement. The rules for when it can be safely omitted are somewhat
complex and error-prone. In this book, every statement that needs a
semicolon will always be terminated by one. I recommend you do the
same in your own programs, at least until you've learned more about
subtleties involved in leaving out semicolons.

== Variables ==

(((syntax)))(((variable,definition)))(((side effect)))(((memory)))How
does a program keep an internal ((state))? How does it remember
things? We have seen how to produce new values from old values, but
this does not change the old values, and the new value has to be
immediately used or it will dissipate again. To catch and hold values,
JavaScript provides a thing called a _variable_.

[source,javascript]
----
var caught = 5 * 5;
----

(((var keyword)))And that gives us our second kind of ((statement)).
The special word (_((keyword))_) `var` indicates that this sentence is
going to define a variable. It is followed by the name of the
variable, an `=` operator, and an expression.

The previous statement creates a variable called `caught` and uses it
to grab hold of the number that is produced by multiplying 5 by 5.

After a variable has been defined, its name can be used as an
((expression)). The value of such an expression is the value the
variable currently holds. Here's an example:

[source,javascript]
----
var ten = 10;
print(ten * ten);
// → 100
----

(((underscore character)))(((dollar
sign)))(((variable,naming)))Variable names can be any word that isn't
a reserved word (such as `var`). They may not include spaces.
Digits can also be part of variable names—`catch22` is a valid name,
for example—but the name must not start with a digit. A variable name
cannot include punctuation, except for the characters `$` and `_`.

(((var keyword)))A single `var` statement may define multiple
variables. The definitions must be separated by commas.

[source,javascript]
----
var one = 1, two = 2;
print(one + two);
// → 3
----

== Keywords and reserved words ==

(((syntax)))(((implements (reserved word))))(((interface (reserved
word))))(((let keyword)))(((package (reserved word))))(((private
(reserved word))))(((protected (reserved word))))(((public (reserved
word))))(((static (reserved word))))(((void operator)))(((yield
(reserved word))))(((reserved word)))(((variable,naming)))Words with
a special meaning, such as `var`, are _((keyword))s_, and they may not
be used as variable names. There are also a number of words that are
“reserved for use” in ((future)) versions of JavaScript. These are also
officially not allowed to be used as variable names, though some
JavaScript environments do allow them. The full list of keywords and
reserved words is rather long.

[source,text/plain]
----
break case catch class const continue debugger
default delete do else enum export extends false
finally for function if implements import in
instanceof interface let new null package private
protected public return static super switch this
throw true try typeof var void while with yield
----

Don't worry about memorizing these, but remember that this might be
the problem when a variable definition does not work as expected.

== The environment ==

(((standard environment)))The collection of variables and their values
that exist at a given time is called the _((environment))_. When a
program starts up, this environment is not empty. It always contains
variables that are part of the language ((standard)), and most of the
time, it has variables that provide ways to interact with the
surrounding system. For example, in a ((browser)), there are variables
and functions to inspect and influence the currently loaded website
and to read ((mouse)) and ((keyboard)) input.

== Functions ==

indexsee:[application (of functions),function application]
indexsee:[invoking (of functions),function application]
indexsee:[calling (of functions),function application]
(((output)))(((function)))(((function,application)))(((alert
function)))(((message box)))Up until now, every value (numbers,
images, booleans) we have created have been unchanging - even with our
most complicated images, they don't change. Sometimes, we want to be
able to create values that are based on other values. For example, we
might want to make an image where the color could vary, based on how
we wanted to use it. To do this, we create _functions_. A function is
a specification for how to create a value depending on some other
values, which are alternatively called _arguments_ or
_parameters_. Functions can also cause side effects (for example, our
`print` function causes values to be shown on the screen - previously,
we referred to `print` as an operator, to make it analogous to `+` or
`*`, but function is the proper name). Even though they are quite a
bit more sophisticated, functions are values just like numbers,
strings, and images - they can be passed as arguments, stored in
variables, etc.

We define functions with the `function` keyword. For example, the
following code defines the variable `square` to refer to a function
that produces the square of a given number:

[source,javascript]
----
var square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
};

print(square(12));
// → 144
----

The `function` keyword is followed by parenthesis, and within those
are a comma-separated list of argument names. When you _apply_ the
function, these names will be where the input values are. The body of
the function (between the `{` and `}`) should eventually produce a
value (it can also do other things first). To produce a value, you use
the `return` keyword. There is a little more about `return` in the
next section.

(((parameter)))(((function,application)))Using a function is
called _invoking_, _calling_, or _applying_ it. You can call a
function by putting ((parentheses)) after an expression that produces
a function value. Usually you'll directly use the name of the variable
that holds the function. We can also define a new name for `square`,
and use that instead:

[source,javascript]
----
var square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
};

var my_better_square = square;
print(square(12));
----

Built in functions like `print` can also be given new names:

[source,javascript]
----
var my_better_print = print;
my_better_print("Hello there!");
----

The values between the parentheses are given to the program inside the
function. In the example, the `square` function uses the integer `12`
that we give it as the text to show.  Values given to functions are
called _((argument))s_. The `square` function needs only one of them,
but other functions might need a different number or different types
of arguments.

[[return_values]]
== Return values ==

(((comparison,of numbers)))(((return value)))(((Math.max
function)))(((maximum)))Writing text to the screen is a _((side
effect))_. But functions produce values, and these are usually why we
want to use them. For example, the function `Math.max` takes any
number of number values and gives back the greatest.

[source,javascript]
----
print(Math.max(2, 4));
// → 4
----


(((function,application)))(((minimum)))(((Math.min function)))The
value that a function produces is called the _return_ value, and the
function is said to have _returned_ the value. Anything that produces
a value is an ((expression)) in JavaScript, which means function calls
can be used within larger expressions. Here a call to `Math.min`,
which is the opposite of `Math.max`, is used as an input to the plus
operator:

[source,javascript]
----
print(Math.min(2, 4) + 100);
// → 102
----

== Dots in function names ==

(((object)))Though ((variable)) names cannot contain ((period
character))s, `Math.max` clearly has one. This is because `Math.max`
isn't a simple variable. It is actually an expression that retrieves
the `max` ((property)) from the value held by the `Math` variable. We
will go into more detail on this later, but for now, you can use these
identifiers the same way you would your own variables.

== Comments ==

(((readability)))Often, raw code does not convey all the information
you want a program to convey to human readers, or it conveys it in
such a cryptic way that people might not understand it. At other
times, you might just feel poetic or want to include some thoughts as
part of your program. This is what _((comment))s_ are for.

(((slash character)))(((line comment)))A comment is a piece of text
that is part of a program but is completely ignored by the computer.
JavaScript has two ways of writing comments. To write a single-line
comment, you can use two slash characters (`//`) and then the comment
text after it.


(((block comment)))A `//` comment goes only to the end of the line. A
section of text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored, regardless of
whether it contains line breaks. This is often useful for adding
blocks of information about a file or a chunk of program.

[source,javascript]
----
/*
 I first found this number scrawled on the back of one of
 my notebooks a few years ago. Since then, it has often
 dropped by, showing up in phone numbers and the serial
 numbers of products that I've bought. It obviously likes
 me, so I've decided to keep it.
*/
var myNumber = 11213;
----

== More functions ==

(((power example)))A function can have multiple parameters or no
parameters at all. In the following example, `makeNoise` does not list
any parameter names, whereas `emphasize` lists two:

[source,javascript]
----
var makeNoise = function() {
  print("Pling!");
};

makeNoise();
// → Pling!

var emphasize = function(string) {
  return string + "!!!!";
};

print(emphasize("hello there"));
// → hello there!!!!
----

(((return value)))(((return keyword)))(((undefined)))Some functions
explicitly `return` a value, such as `emphasize` and `square`, and some
don't, such as `makeNoise`. A `return` statement determines the value
the function returns. When control comes across such a statement, it
immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned
value to the code that called the function. The `return` keyword
without an expression after it will cause the function to return
`undefined`. If there is no `return` statement, your function also
returns `undefined`.

For example:

[source,javascript]
----
var my_function = function() {

};
print(my_function());
----

== Functions for drawing ==

You can create an empty scene with:

[source,javascript]
----
var scene = emptyScene(400,100);
print(scene);
----

And we can place a bicycle on that scene using the `placeImage` function, which is like `overlay` but it takes, additionally, how far from the left and top to place the first over the second image:

[source,javascript]
----
var scene = placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400,100), 0, 30);
print(scene);
----

We can move the bike across the scene:

[source,javascript]
----
print(placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400,100), 0, 30));
print(placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400,100), 100, 30));
print(placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400,100), 200, 30));
print(placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400,100), 300, 30));
----

Instead of just creating those scenes, we can write a function that,
given the position of the bike, draws the scene.

[source,javascript]
----
var draw_bike = function(position) {
  return placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400,100), position, 30);
};
print(draw_bike(100));
print(draw_bike(200));
print(draw_bike(300));
----

This looks something like the images in a flip book, right? In a flip book,
each page has a different image and you can view an animation by
flipping the pages in sequence. So lets turn this into an animation!

TLC.js has a function called `animate` that can create animations from
functions like this. It takes a function that returns an image (like our
_draw_bike_). Then it calls that function with the number 0 and draws the
image. It calls it again with 1, and draws that image... and the
same for 2, 3 ,4... And keeps going forever, feeding your function increasing
numbers and drawing the result, approximately 60 times a second!

[source,javascript]
----
var draw_bike = function(ticksSinceStart) {
  var xPosition = ticksSinceStart;
  return placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400,100), xPosition, 30);
};
animate(draw_bike);
----

== A shorter way to define functions ==

Since giving names to functions by storing them in variables is really
common, there is a shorter way to do these two things:

[source,javascript]
----
var name = function(arg) { return arg; };
// Is equivalent to:
function name(arg) { return arg; }
----

The second is a little shorter and doesn't have a semicolon at the end.

== Parameters and scopes ==

(((function,application)))(((variable,from parameter)))The
((parameter))s to a function behave like regular variables, but their
initial values are given by the _caller_ of the function, not the code
in the function itself.

(((function,scope)))(((scope)))(((local variable)))An important
property of functions is that the variables created inside of them,
including their parameters, are _local_ to the function. This means
that any variables defined within functions will be newly created
every time the function is called, and these separate incarnations do
not interfere with each other.

indexsee:[top-level scope,global scope]
(((var keyword)))(((global scope)))(((variable,global)))This
“localness” of variables applies only to the parameters and to variables
declared with the `var` keyword inside the function body. Variables
declared outside of any function are called _global_, because they are
visible throughout the program. It is possible to access such
variables from inside a function, as long as you haven't declared a
local variable with the same name.

(((variable,assignment)))The following code demonstrates this. It
declares the variable as local and thus changes only the local
variable, which is unchanged.

[source,javascript]
----
var x = "outside";

var f1 = function() {
  var x = "inside f1";
};
f1();
print(x);
// → outside
----

(((variable,naming)))(((scope)))(((global scope)))(((code,structure
of)))This behavior helps prevent accidental interference between
functions. If all variables were shared by the whole program, it'd
take a lot of effort to make sure no name is ever used for two
different purposes. By treating function-local variables as existing
only within the function, the language makes it possible to read and
understand functions as small universes, without having to worry about
all the code at once.

== Animation ==

_animate_ calls your drawing function with a number. That number
represents how many "ticks" have happened since the animation started.

Note: in the following, we want to turn a number (of ticks) into an
image. We have a function called `text` that takes a string (like
`"hello"`) and turns it into an image. So if we could first take our
number (like `12` and turn it into a string `"12"`), then we could
turn it into an image with text. Javascript has a built in function
that is called `String` that does just that. You can see it in use in
the below example. If you are trying to do the reverse (turn a string
like `"1001"` into the number `1001`), there is a corresponding
function `Number`.

[source,javascript]
----
function show_how_many_ticks(ticksSinceStart) {
  return text(String(ticksSinceStart), 16);
}

animate(show_how_many_ticks);
----

This number (corresponding to the annoying linear nature of time as we
conventionally experience it) is always getting bigger at a constant
rate. So it makes sense that we can use it to create an animation of something
growing or moving forward:

[source,javascript]
----
function growingCircle(time) {
  var size = time;
  return overlay(circle(size, "red"), emptyScene(200, 200));
}

animate(growingCircle);

function movingCircle(time) {
  var xPosition = time;
  return placeImage(circle(10, "black"), emptyScene(200, 30), xPosition, 5);
}

animate(movingCircle);
----

But while a steady march forward into infinity isn't a terrible
approximation of how we experience changes in time, it's still not a
very useful way to represent how things change shape or
position. Things don't always grow, sometimes they shrink.  Things
move backwards as well as forwards. And sometimes they move faster or
slower. How do we take a number that is always getting bigger (the
amount of time that has passed) and turn it into a number that changes
in a different way?

We can think about the different tools we have already. We have lots
of operators: `-`, `+`, `*`, and `/`. We'll also introduce a new
operator, `%` (pronounced "mod"). Let's see what happens when we use
these operators with animate!

Hmmm. All these operators can take two arguments. One of them is
going to be time, but we need another number. This is just an experiment
so lets pick any number... How about 100?

[source,javascript]
----
function adding(time) {
  return text("100 + the current time (" + String(time) + ") is " + (100 + time), 16);
}

animate(adding);
----

[source,javascript]
----
function subtracting(time) {
  return text("100 - the current time (" + String(time) + ") is " + String(100 - time), 16);
}

animate(subtracting);
----

[source,javascript]
----
function multiplying(time) {
  return text("100 * the current time (" + String(time) + ") is " + String(100 * time), 16);
}

animate(multiplying);
----

[source,javascript]
----
function dividing(time) {
  return text("100 / the current time (" + String(time) + ") is " + String(100 / time), 16);
}

animate(dividing);
----

Now for the new operator:

[source,javascript]
----
// `%` divides by the number by another number and returns
// the remainder
function modding(time) {
  return text("the current time (" + String(time) + ") % 100 is " + String(time % 100), 16);
}

animate(modding);
----

So you can see that the `time` going into the function is always increasing at
the same rate, just like before. But now, some of the resulting numbers are
increasing and some are decreasing, and they are doing that at different rates!

What does that look like when we apply it to images?

[source,javascript]
----
function adding1(time) {
  var radius = 100 + time;
  return overlay(circle(radius, "red"), emptyScene(200, 200));
}

function adding2(time) {
  var xPosition = 100 + time;
  return placeImage(circle(10, "black"), emptyScene(200, 30), xPosition, 5);
}

animate(adding1);
animate(adding2);
----

[source,javascript]
----
function subtracting1(time) {
  var radius = 100 - time;
  return overlay(circle(radius, "red"), emptyScene(200, 200));
}

function subtracting2(time) {
  var xPosition = 100 - time;
  return placeImage(circle(10, "black"), emptyScene(200, 30), xPosition, 5);
}

animate(subtracting1)
animate(subtracting2);
----

The next two cause changes so fast or so slow that it's hard to
even see.

[source,javascript]
----
function multiplying1(time) {
  var radius = time * 100;
  return overlay(circle(radius, "red"), emptyScene(200, 200));
}

function multiplying2(time) {
  var xPosition = time * 100;
  return placeImage(circle(10, "black"), emptyScene(200, 30), xPosition, 5);
}

animate(multiplying1);
animate(multiplying2); // moves so fast you can't even see it!
----

[source,javascript]
----
function dividing1(time) {
  var radius = time / 100;
  return overlay(circle(radius, "red"), emptyScene(200, 200));
}

function dividing2(time) {
  var xPosition = time / 100;
  return placeImage(circle(10, "black"), emptyScene(200, 30), xPosition, 5);
}

animate(dividing1);
animate(dividing2); // moves so slow you can hardly tell!
----

Try multiplying and dividing by 10 instead of 100 and see what
happens! Try even smaller numbers and bigger numbers!

[source,javascript]
----
function modding1(time){
  var radius = time % 100;
  return overlay(circle(radius, "red"), emptyScene(200, 200));
}

function modding2(time){
  var xPosition = time % 100;
  return placeImage(circle(10, "black"), emptyScene(200, 30), xPosition, 5);
}

animate(modding1);
animate(modding2);
----

Using `%` in animation creates a looping effect! How would you make the
circle in `modding2` go all the way to the end of the box?

== Fluid movement with _sin_ ==

Another fun function for making animations is `Math.sin`. This is the _sin_
function from math. You can fiddle with this to get interesting things to happen:

[source,javascript]
----
function sinWiggle(ticksSinceStart) {
  var xPosition = Math.sin(ticksSinceStart/20) * 90 + 90;
  return placeImage(circle(10, "black"), emptyScene(200, 30), xPosition, 5);
}

animate(sinWiggle);
----

The cool thing about _sin_ and _cos_ is that `Math.sin(anything)` and
`Math.cos(anything)` are always numbers between -1 and 1.

[source,javascript]
----
print(Math.sin(0));
print(Math.sin(100));
print(Math.sin(500000));
----

If you multiply the result of `sin(some number)`
by 90, you will always get a number between -90 and 90.

[source,javascript]
----
print(Math.sin(0) * 90);
print(Math.sin(100) * 90);
print(Math.sin(500000) * 90);
----

We use that fact in
_sinWiggle_. We multiple by 90 to always get a number between -90 and 90.
Then we add 90, so the number is always between 0 and 180.

[source,javascript]
----
print(Math.sin(0) * 90 + 90);
print(Math.sin(100) * 90 + 90);
print(Math.sin(500000) * 90 + 90);
----

So _sinWiggle_ takes a number, no matter how big, and turns that into  an
image placing a dot.
A helpful operator is `%`, which is pronounced _mod_. It takes the
_remainder_ after diving the right side by the left side.

== Control flow ==

(((execution order)))(((program)))(((control flow)))When your program
contains more than one ((statement)), the statements are executed,
predictably, from top to bottom. As a basic example, this program has
two statements.

[source,javascript]
----
print(bike);
print(circle(100, "green"));
----

Here is the rather trivial schematic representation of straight
control flow:

image::img/controlflow-straight.svg[alt="Trivial control flow",width="4cm"]

== Conditional execution ==

(((Boolean)))(((control flow)))Executing statements in straight-line
order isn't the only option we have. An alternative is _((conditional
execution))_, where we choose between two different routes based on a
Boolean value, like this:

image::img/controlflow-if.svg[alt="Conditional control flow",width="4cm"]

(((syntax)))(((Number function)))(((if keyword)))Conditional execution
is written with the `if` keyword in JavaScript. In the simple case, we
just want some code to be executed if, and only if, a certain
condition holds. For example, we can write a function that returns one message if a number is bigger than zero and another if it is smaller!

[source,javascript]
----
var sign = function(number) {
  if (number > 0) {
    return "it's a positive number";
  } else {
    return "it's not a positive number";
  }
};

print(sign(8));
print(sign(0));
print(sign(-15));
----

If we have more than two paths to choose from, multiple if/else pairs can be “chained” together. We can use that to make our message more informative:

[source,javascript]
----
var sign = function(number) {
  if (number > 0) {
    return "it's a positive number";
  } else if (number === 0) {
    return "it's zero";
  } else {
    return "it's a negative number";
  }
};

print(sign(8));
print(sign(0));
print(sign(-15));
----

The flow chart for this program looks something like this:

image::img/controlflow-nested-if.svg[alt="Nested if control flow",width="4cm"]


We can also use this to improve our bike animation. Previously, when
the bike reached the edge of the scene, it kept going. Instead, we can
make it stop!

[source,javascript]
----
var draw_bike = function(position) {
  if (position > 300) {
    return placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400,100), 300, 30);
  } else {
    return placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400,100), position, 30);
  }
};
animate(draw_bike);
----

== Exercises ==

1. __Magical Teleporting Bike__

Let's try making a magical teleporting bike!

This magical bike rides on the ground for the first part of its journey. When it reaches the carefully guarded, top secret, Original Magic Teleportation Point (known to UFO buffs as Position 80), it jumps up into the sky! When it reaches the next Magical Teleportation Point (known by the initiate as Position 160), it jumps back down to the ground. When it reaches the end of its Magical Road (at the pitstop locals like to call Position 320), it stops.

We've sketched out a skeleton of what a program for creating such a Magical Teleporting Bike might look like below. Try replacing the comments with running code and giving the Magical Teleporting Bike for a spin!

[source,javascript]
----
var draw_bike = function(position) {
  if (position < 80) {
    return placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400,100), position, 30);
  } else if (position < 160) {
    // jump to the top!
  } else if (position < 320){
    // jump back to the bottom!
  } else {
    // stop!
  }

2. Make an image you already made move!

In chapter 1, at the end, you may have drawn an image. Now that you
have `animate`, you should be able to make some part (or many parts)
of your image move.

3. __Extra credit: Go Backwards!__

Can you think of a way to replace the comment with code that will make the bike go backwards once it reaches the right-most part of the scene?

[source,javascript]
----
var draw_bike = function(position) {
  if (position < 400) {
    return placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400, 100), position, 30);
  } else {
    return placeImage(bike, emptyScene(400, 100), /*what goes here?*/ 30)
  };
};

animate(draw_bike);

4. __Extra credit: Back and forth forever__

Using `mod`, can you figure out how to make the bike run back and
forth across the screen forever?

== Summary ==

You now know that a program is built out of statements, which
themselves sometimes contain more statements. Statements tend to
contain expressions, which themselves can be built out of smaller
expressions.

Putting statements after one another gives you a program that is
executed from top to bottom. You can introduce disturbances in the
flow of control by using conditional (`if`, `else if`, `else`) statements.

Variables can be used to file pieces of data under a name, and they
are useful for organizing your program. The environment is the
set of variables that are defined. JavaScript systems
always put a number of useful standard variables into your
environment.

Functions are special values that encapsulate a piece of program. You
can invoke them by writing `functionName(argument1, argument2)`. Such
a function call is an expression, and produces a value.
